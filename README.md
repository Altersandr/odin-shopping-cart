During the development of this Web App i have learned more about React Hooks, React Router.

I have use the useState hook to keep track of the items that were added to the cart, useEffect to fetch the fake merchandise from the fakestore api.

React Router library was used to easily switch between the homepage the shop and contact pages without loading the page.

Special thanks to flaticon.com for the social media icons and https://github.com/IanLunn/Hover for the hover effects.
